You are invited to participate in this research survey because of your work related to sea-level rise policy planning and collaboration in the tri-county area (Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester counties). The purpose of this research is to first identify critical sea-level rise stakeholders in the tri-county area (Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester counties) and assess the following themes: perceptions of sea-level rise planning and policies, preferences for mitigation strategies, and the status of organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement.  
We expect that this survey will take about 20 minutes to complete. 
Participation is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.  Completion of the survey constitutes your consent to participate in this research. I will keep your information strictly confidential. At no time will you be able to be identified in any reports or publications which result from this research.

The data collected for this research will be stored and used for analysis in a thesis project titled “Assessing the Sea-level Rise Governance Gap in the Charleston Tri-County Area” and has potential for publication in the future. The project analysis may be used in addressing sea-level rise policy discrepancies and collaborative gaps. If you have any questions concerning this research study please contact Emmi Palenbaum at palenbaumes@g.cofc.edu or my faculty advisor, Dr. Matthew Nowlin, at nowlinm@cofc.edu.
