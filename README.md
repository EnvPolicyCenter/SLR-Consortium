# Template Repository

This repository is a template for SLR Consortium members to replicate for data analyses and papers. In order for you to use this repository, you must have a Github account plus [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/), and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) downloaded on your computer.

1.  To get started, create a new repo on GitHub from this template. You can do this by clicking "Use this template" in the top right hand corner of this repo.

2.  When making a new repo, leave SLR Consortium as the repo owner and leave visibility as "Private".

3.  Clone the repository to your computer via RStudio ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)). The template repo comes with the following files:

-   README.md

-   Folders: 0_Data, 1_Scripts

    -   Note: The data folder has a *template_data* folder with two sub-folders: *original_datasets* and *standardized_datasets*. The *original_datasets* folder has the raw survey datasets and copies of the survey instruments. The *standardized_datasets* folder has a codebook that contains information on data columns in each case study location's standardized dataset. 

-   .gitignore

4.  After you have created a new repo for your paper, replace the ALL-CAPITALS text with your specific information in the README.md file.
